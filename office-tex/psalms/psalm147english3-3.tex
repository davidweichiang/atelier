\noindent O praise the \uline{Lord}, Jerusalem!~$\star$~\nopagebreak

Zion, \uline{praise} your God!

\noindent He has strengthened the bars \uline{of} your gates,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

he has blessed the chil\uline{dren} within you.

\noindent He established peace \uline{on} your borders,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

he feeds you with \uline{fin}est wheat.

\noindent He sends out his word \uline{to} the earth~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and swiftly runs \uline{his} command.

\noindent He showers down snow white as \uline{wool},~†~\nopagebreak

he scatters hoar-\uline{frost} like ashes.

He hurls down hail\uline{stones} like crumbs.

\noindent The waters are frozen at his \uline{touch};~†~\nopagebreak

he sends forth his word \uline{and} it melts them:~$\star$~\nopagebreak

at the breath of his mouth the \uline{wa}ters flow.

\noindent He makes his word \uline{known} to Jacob,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

to Israel his laws \uline{and} decrees.

\noindent He has not dealt thus with \uline{oth}er nations;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

he has not taught them \uline{his} decrees.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and \uline{to} the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the \uline{Ho}ly Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the begin\uline{ning}, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ev\uline{er}. Amen.
