\noindent If the Lord does not build the house, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

in vain do its builders labor;

\noindent if the Lord does not watch over the city, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

in vain does the watchman keep vigil.

\noindent In vain is your earlier rising, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

your going later to rest,

\noindent you who toil for the bread you eat, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

when he pours gifts on his beloved while they slumber.

\noindent Truly sons are a gift from the Lord, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

a blessing, the fruit of the womb.

\noindent Indeed the sons of youth ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

are like arrows in the hand of a warrior.

\noindent O the happiness of the man ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

who has filled his quiver with these arrows!

\noindent He will have no cause for shame ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

when he disputes with his foes in the gateways. 

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
