\noindent The Lord’s revelation to my Master:~†~\nopagebreak

“Sit on my right:~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

your foes I will put beneath your feet.”

\noindent The Lord will wield from Zion~†~\nopagebreak

your scepter of power:~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

rule in the midst of all your foes.

\noindent A prince from the day of your birth~†~\nopagebreak

on the holy mountains;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

from the womb before the dawn I begot you.

\noindent The Lord has sworn an oath he will not change.~†~\nopagebreak

“You are a priest for ever,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

a priest like Melchizedek of old.”

\noindent The Master standing at your right hand~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

will shatter kings in the day of his great wrath.

\noindent He shall drink from the stream by the wayside~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and therefore he shall lift up his head.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
