\noindent Lord, who shall be admitted to your tent~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and dwell on your holy mountain?

\noindent He who walks without fault;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

he who acts with justice

\noindent and speaks the truth from his heart;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

he who does not slander with his tongue;

\noindent he who do no wrong to his brother,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

who casts no slur on his neighbor,

\noindent who holds the godless in disdain,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

but honors those who fear the Lord;

\noindent he who keeps his pledge, come what may;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

who takes no interest on a loan

\noindent and accepts no bribes against the innocent.~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

Such a man will stand firm for ever.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
