\noindent Though he was in the form of \uline{God}, ~†~\nopagebreak

Jesus did not deem equality \uline{with} God ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

something \uline{to} be grasped at.

\noindent Rather, he emptied him\uline{self} ~†~\nopagebreak

and took the form of \uline{a} slave, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

being born in the like\uline{ness} of men.

\noindent He was known to be of human \uline{es}tate, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and it was thus that he hum\uline{bled} himself,

\noindent obediently accepting ev\uline{en} death, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

death \uline{on} a cross!

\noindent Because \uline{of} this, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

God high\uline{ly} exalted him

\noindent and bestowed on him \uline{the} name ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

above every \uline{oth}er name,

\noindent So that at Je\uline{sus}’ name~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

every \uline{knee} must bend

\noindent in the heavens, on \uline{the} earth, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and un\uline{der} the earth,

\noindent and every tongue pro\uline{claim} ~†~\nopagebreak

to the glory of God \uline{the} Father: ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

JESUS \uline{CHRIST} IS LORD!

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to \uline{the} Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the \uline{Ho}ly Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, \uline{is} now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ev\uline{er}. Amen.
