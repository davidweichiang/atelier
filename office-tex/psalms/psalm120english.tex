\noindent I lift up my eyes to the mountains:~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

from where shall come my help?

\noindent My help shall come from the Lord~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

who made heaven and earth.

\noindent May he never allow you to stumble!~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

Let him sleep not, your guard.

\noindent No, he sleeps not nor slumbers,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

Israelâ€™s guard.

\noindent The Lord is your guard and your shade;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

at your right side he stands.

\noindent By day the sun shall not smite you~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

nor the moon in the night.

\noindent The Lord will guard you from evil,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

he will guard your soul.

\noindent The Lord will guard your going and coming~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

both now and for ever.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
