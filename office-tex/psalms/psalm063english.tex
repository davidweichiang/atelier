\noindent Hear my voice, O God, as I complain,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

guard my life from dread of the foe.

\noindent Hide me from the band of the wicked,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

from the throng of those who do evil.

\noindent They sharpen their tongues like swords;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

they aim bitter words like arrows

\noindent to shoot at the innocent from ambush,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

shooting suddenly and recklessly.

\noindent They scheme their evil course;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

they conspire to lay secret snares.

\noindent They say: “Who will see us?~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

Who can search out our crimes?”

\noindent He will search who searches the mind~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and knows the depth of the heart.

\noindent God has shot them with his arrow~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and dealt them sudden wounds.

\noindent Their own tongue has brought them to ruin~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and all who see them mock.

\noindent Then will all men fear;~†~\nopagebreak

they will tell what God has done.~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

They will understand God’s deeds.

\noindent The just will rejoice in the Lord~†~\nopagebreak

and fly to him for refuge.~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

All the upright hearts will glory.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
