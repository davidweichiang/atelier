\noindent Hear my voice, O God, as I complain,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

guard my life from dread of the foe.

\noindent Hide me from the band of the wicked,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

from the throng of those who do evil.

\noindent They sharpen their tongues like swords;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

they aim bitter words like arrows

\noindent to shoot at the innocent from ambush,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

shooting suddenly and recklessly.

\noindent They scheme their evil course;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

they conspire to lay secret snares.

\noindent They say: “Who will see us?~$\star$~\nopagebreak

Who can search out our crimes?”

\noindent He will search who searches the mind~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and knows the depth of the heart.

\noindent God has shot them with his arrow~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and dealt them sudden wounds.

\noindent Their own tongue has brought them to ruin~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and all who see them mock.

\noindent Then will all men fear;~†~\nopagebreak

they will tell what God has done.~$\star$~\nopagebreak

They will understand God’s deeds.

\noindent The just will rejoice in the Lord~†~\nopagebreak

and fly to him for refuge.~$\star$~\nopagebreak

All the upright hearts will glory.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
