praise him with lute and harp.

\noindent Praise him with timbrel and dance,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

praise him with strings and pipes.

\noindent O praise him with resounding cymbals,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

praise him with clashing of cymbals.

\noindent Let everything that lives and that breathes~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

give praise to the Lord.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
