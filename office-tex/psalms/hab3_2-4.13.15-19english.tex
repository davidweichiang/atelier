\noindent O Lord, I have heard your renown,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and feared, O Lord, your work.

\noindent In the course of the years revive it,~†~\nopagebreak

in the course of the years make it known;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

in your wrath remember compassion!

\noindent God comes from Teman,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

the Holy One from Mount Paran.

\noindent Covered are the heavens with his glory,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and with his praise the earth is filled.

\noindent His splendor spreads like the light;~†~\nopagebreak

rays shine forth from beside him,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

where his power is concealed.

\noindent You come forth to save your people,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

to save your anointed one.

\noindent You tread the sea with your steeds~$\star$~\nopagebreak

amid the churning of the deep waters.

\noindent I hear, and my body trembles;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

at the sound, my lips quiver.

\noindent Decay invades my bones,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

my legs tremble beneath me.

\noindent I await the day of distress~$\star$~\nopagebreak

that will come upon the people who attack us.

\noindent For though the fig tree blossom not~$\star$~\nopagebreak

nor fruit be on the vines,

\noindent though the yield of the olive fail~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and the terraces produce no nourishment,

\noindent though the flocks disappear from the fold~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and there be no herd in the stalls,

\noindent yet will I rejoice in the Lord~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and exult in my saving God.

\noindent God, my Lord, is my strength;~†~\nopagebreak

he makes my feet swift as those of hinds~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and enables me to go upon the heights.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
