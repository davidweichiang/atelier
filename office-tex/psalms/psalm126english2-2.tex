\noindent If the Lord does not build \uline{the} house, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

in vain do its build\uline{ers} labor;

\noindent if the Lord does not watch over \uline{the} city, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

in vain does the watchman \uline{keep} vigil.

\noindent In vain is your earli\uline{er} rising, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

your going later \uline{to} rest,

\noindent you who toil for the bread \uline{you} eat, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

when he pours gifts on his beloved while \uline{they} slumber.

\noindent Truly sons are a gift from \uline{the} Lord, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

a blessing, the fruit of \uline{the} womb.

\noindent Indeed the sons \uline{of} youth ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

are like arrows in the hand of \uline{a} warrior.

\noindent O the happiness of \uline{the} man ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

who has filled his quiver with \uline{these} arrows!

\noindent He will have no cause \uline{for} shame ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

when he disputes with his foes in \uline{the} gateways. 

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to \uline{the} Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Ho\uline{ly} Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, \uline{is} now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. \uline{A}men.
