\noindent Christ suffered for \uline{you},~†~\nopagebreak

and left you an \uline{ex}ample ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

to have you follow in \uline{his} footsteps.

\noindent He did \uline{no} wrong; ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

no deceit was found in \uline{his} mouth.

\noindent When he was \uline{in}sulted, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

he returned \uline{no} insult.

\noindent When he was made \uline{to} suffer, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

he did not counter \uline{with} threats.

\noindent Instead he delivered him\uline{self} up ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

to the One who judg\uline{es} justly.

\noindent In his \uline{own} body ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

he brought your sins \uline{to} the cross,

\noindent so that all of us, dead to \uline{sin},~†~\nopagebreak

could live in accord with \uline{God’s} will. ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

By his wounds you \uline{were} healed.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to \uline{the} Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Ho\uline{ly} Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, \uline{is} now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. \uline{A}men.
