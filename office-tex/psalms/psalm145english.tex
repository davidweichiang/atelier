\noindent My soul, give praise to the Lord;~†~\nopagebreak

I will praise the Lord all my days,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

make music to my God while I live.

\noindent Put no trust in princes,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

in mortal men in whom there is no help.

\noindent Take their breath, they return to clay~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and their plans that day come to nothing.

\noindent He is happy who is helped by Jacob’s God,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

whose hope is in the Lord his God,

\noindent who alone made heaven and earth,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

the seas and all they contain.

\noindent It is he who keeps faith for ever,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

who is just to those who are oppressed.

\noindent It is he who gives bread to the hungry,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

the Lord, who sets prisoners free,

\noindent the Lord who gives sight to the blind,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

who raises up those who are bowed down,

\noindent the Lord, who protects the stranger~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and upholds the widow and orphan.

\noindent It is the Lord who loves the just~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

but thwarts the path of the wicked.

\noindent The Lord will reign for ever,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

Zion’s God, from age to age.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
