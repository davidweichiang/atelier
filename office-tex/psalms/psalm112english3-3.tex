\noindent Praise, O servants \uline{of} the Lord,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

praise the name \uline{of} the Lord!

\noindent May the name of the \uline{Lord} be blessed~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

both now and for \uline{ev}ermore!

\noindent From the rising of the sun \uline{to} its setting~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

praised be the name \uline{of} the Lord!

\noindent High above all nations \uline{is} the Lord,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

above the heav\uline{ens} his glory.

\noindent Who is like the \uline{Lord}, our God,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

who has risen on high \uline{to} his throne

\noindent yet stoops from the heights \uline{to} look down,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

to look down upon heav\uline{en} and earth?

\noindent From the dust he lifts \uline{up} the lowly,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

from his misery he rais\uline{es} the poor

\noindent to set him in the compa\uline{ny} of princes,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

yes, with the princes \uline{of} his people.

\noindent To the childless wife he \uline{gives} a home~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and gladdens her \uline{heart} with children.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and \uline{to} the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the \uline{Ho}ly Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the begin\uline{ning}, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ev\uline{er}. Amen.
