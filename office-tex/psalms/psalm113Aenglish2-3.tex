\noindent When Israel came forth \uline{from} Egypt,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

Jacob’s sons from an a\uline{li}en people,

\noindent Judah became the \uline{Lord’s} temple,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

Israel be\uline{came} his kingdom.

\noindent The sea fled at \uline{the} sight:~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

the Jordan turned back \uline{on} its course,

\noindent the mountains leapt \uline{like} rams~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and the hills like \uline{year}ling sheep.

\noindent Why was it, sea, that \uline{you} fled,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

that you turned back, Jordan, \uline{on} your course?

\noindent Mountains, that you leapt \uline{like} rams,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

hills, like \uline{year}ling sheep?

\noindent Tremble, O earth, before \uline{the} Lord,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

in the presence of the \uline{God} of Jacob,

\noindent who turns the rock into \uline{a} pool~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and flint into a \uline{spring} of water.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to \uline{the} Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the \uline{Ho}ly Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, \uline{is} now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ev\uline{er}. Amen.
