\noindent Why this tumult among nations,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

among peoples this useless murmuring?

\noindent They arise, the kings of the earth,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

princes plot against the Lord and his Anointed.

\noindent “Come let us break their fetters,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

come, let us cast off their yoke.”

\noindent He who sits in the heavens laughs;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

the Lord is laughing them to scorn.

\noindent Then he will speak in his anger,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

his rage will strike them with terror.

\noindent “It is I who have set up my king~$\star$~\nopagebreak

on Zion, my holy mountain.”

\noindent I will announce the decree of the Lord: ~†~\nopagebreak

The Lord said to me: “You are my Son.~$\star$~\nopagebreak

It is I who have begotten you this day.

\noindent Ask and I shall bequeath you the nations,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

put the ends of the earth in your possession.

\noindent With a rod of iron you will break them,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

shatter them like a potter’s jar.”

\noindent Now, O kings, understand,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

take warning, rulers of the earth;

\noindent serve the Lord with awe~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and trembling, pay him your homage

\noindent lest he be angry and you perish;~†~\nopagebreak

for suddenly his anger will blaze.~$\star$~\nopagebreak

Blessed are they who put their trust in God.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
