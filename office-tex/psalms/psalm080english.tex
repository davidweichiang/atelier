\noindent Ring out your joy to God our strength,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

shout in triumph to the God of Jacob.

\noindent Raise a song and sound the timbrel,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

the sweet-sounding harp and the lute,

\noindent blow the trumpet at the new moon,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

when the moon is full, on our feast.

\noindent For this is Israel’s law,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

a command of the God of Jacob.

\noindent He imposed it as a rule on Joseph,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

when he went out against the land of Egypt.

\noindent A voice I did not know said to me:~$\star$~\nopagebreak

“I freed your shoulder from the burden;

\noindent your hands were freed from the load.~$\star$~\nopagebreak

You called in distress and I saved you.

\noindent I answered, concealed in the storm cloud,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

at the waters of Meribah I tested you.

\noindent Listen, my people, to my warning,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

O Israel, if only you would heed!

\noindent Let there be no foreign god among you,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

no worship of an alien god.

\noindent I am the Lord your God,~†~\nopagebreak

who brought you from the land of Egypt.~$\star$~\nopagebreak

Open wide your mouth and I will fill it.

\noindent But my people did not heed my voice~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and Israel would not obey,

\noindent so I left them in their stubbornness of heart~$\star$~\nopagebreak

to follow their own designs.

\noindent O that my people would heed me,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

that Israel would walk in my ways!

\noindent At once I would subdue their foes,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

turn my hand against their enemies.

\noindent The Lord’s enemies would cringe at their feet~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and their subjection would last for ever.

\noindent But Israel I would feed with finest wheat~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and fill them with honey from the rock.”

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
