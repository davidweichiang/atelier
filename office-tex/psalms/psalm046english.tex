\noindent All peoples, clap your hands,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

cry to God with shouts of joy!

\noindent For the Lord, the Most High, we must fear,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

great king over all the earth.

\noindent He subdues peoples under us~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and nations under our feet.

\noindent Our inheritance, our glory, is from him,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

given to Jacob out of love.

\noindent God goes up with shouts of joy;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

the Lord goes up with trumpet blast.

\noindent Sing praise for God, sing praise,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

sing praise to our king, sing praise.

\noindent God is king of all the earth.~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

Sing praise with all your skill.

\noindent God is king over the nations;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

God reigns on his holy throne.

\noindent The princes of the peoples are assembled~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

with the people of Abrahamâ€™s God.

\noindent The rulers of the earth belong to God,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

to God who reigns over all.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
