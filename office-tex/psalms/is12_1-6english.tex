\noindent I give you thanks, O Lord;~†~\nopagebreak

though you have been angry with me,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

your anger has abated, and you have consoled me.

\noindent God indeed is my savior;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

I am confident and unafraid.

\noindent My strength and my courage is the Lord,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and he has been my savior.

\noindent With joy you will draw water~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

at the fountain of salvation, and say on that day:

\noindent Give thanks to the Lord, acclaim his name;~†~\nopagebreak

among the nations make known his deeds,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

proclaim how exalted is his name.

\noindent Sing praise to the Lord for his glorious achievement;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

let this be known throughout all the earth.

\noindent Shout with exultation, O city of Zion,~†~\nopagebreak

for great in your midst~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

is the Holy One of Israel!

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
