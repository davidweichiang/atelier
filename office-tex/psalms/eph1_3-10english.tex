\noindent Praised be the God and Father ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

of our Lord Jesus Christ

\noindent who has bestowed on us in Christ ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

every spiritual blessing in the heavens.

\noindent God chose us in him ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

before the world began

\noindent to be holy ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and blameless in his sight.

\noindent He predestined us ~†~\nopagebreak

to be his adopted sons through Jesus Christ, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

such was his will and pleasure,

\noindent that all might praise the glorious favor ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

he has bestowed on us in his beloved.

\noindent In him and through his blood, we have been redeemed, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and our sins forgiven,

\noindent so immeasurably generous ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

is God’s favor to us.

\noindent God has given us the wisdom ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

to understand fully the mystery,

\noindent the plan he was pleased ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

to decree in Christ.

\noindent A plan to be carried out in Christ, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

in the fullness of time,

\noindent to bring all things into one in him, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

in the heavens and on earth.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
