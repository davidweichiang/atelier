\noindent Out of the depths I cry to \uline{you}, O Lord,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

Lord, \uline{hear} my voice!

\noindent O let your ears \uline{be} attentive~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

to the voice \uline{of} my pleading.

\noindent If you, O Lord, should \uline{mark} our guilt,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

Lord, who \uline{would} survive?

\noindent But with you is \uline{found} forgiveness:~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

for this \uline{we} revere you.

\noindent My soul is waiting \uline{for} the Lord,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

I count \uline{on} his word.

\noindent My soul is longing \uline{for} the Lord~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

more than watch\uline{man} for daybreak.

\noindent Let the watchman \uline{count} on daybreak~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and Israel \uline{on} the Lord.

\noindent Because with the Lord \uline{there} is mercy~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and fullness \uline{of} redemption,

\noindent Israel indeed he \uline{will} redeem~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

from all \uline{its} iniquity.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and \uline{to} the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the \uline{Ho}ly Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the begin\uline{ning}, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ev\uline{er}. Amen.
