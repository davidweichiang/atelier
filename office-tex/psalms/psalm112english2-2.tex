\noindent Praise, O servants of \uline{the} Lord,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

praise the name of \uline{the} Lord!

\noindent May the name of the Lord \uline{be} blessed~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

both now and for ev\uline{er}more!

\noindent From the rising of the sun to \uline{its} setting~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

praised be the name of \uline{the} Lord!

\noindent High above all nations is \uline{the} Lord,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

above the heavens \uline{his} glory.

\noindent Who is like the Lord, \uline{our} God,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

who has risen on high to \uline{his} throne

\noindent yet stoops from the heights to \uline{look} down,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

to look down upon heaven \uline{and} earth?

\noindent From the dust he lifts up \uline{the} lowly,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

from his misery he raises \uline{the} poor

\noindent to set him in the company \uline{of} princes,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

yes, with the princes of \uline{his} people.

\noindent To the childless wife he gives \uline{a} home~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and gladdens her heart \uline{with} children.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to \uline{the} Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Ho\uline{ly} Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, \uline{is} now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. \uline{A}men.
