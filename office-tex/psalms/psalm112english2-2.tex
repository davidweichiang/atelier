\noindent High above all nations is \uline{the} Lord,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

above the heavens \uline{his} glory.

\noindent Who is like the Lord, \uline{our} God,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

who has risen on high to \uline{his} throne

yes, with the princes of \uline{his} people.

\noindent To the childless wife he gives \uline{a} home~$\star$~\nopagebreak
