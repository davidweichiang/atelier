\noindent I rejoiced when I \uline{heard} them say: ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

“Let us go \uline{to} God’s house.”

\noindent And now our \uline{feet} are standing ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

within your gates, \uline{O} Jerusalem.

\noindent Jerusalem is built \uline{as} a city ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

strong\uline{ly} compact.

\noindent It is there that the \uline{tribes} go up, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

the tribes \uline{of} the Lord.

\noindent For Israel’s \uline{law} it is, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

there to praise \uline{the} Lord’s name.

\noindent There were set the \uline{thrones} of judgment ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

of the \uline{house} of David.

\noindent For the peace of Jeru\uline{sa}lem pray: ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

“Peace be \uline{to} your homes!

\noindent May peace reign \uline{in} your walls, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

in your pal\uline{ac}es, peace!”

\noindent For love of my breth\uline{ren} and friends ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

I say: “\uline{Peace} upon you.”

\noindent For love of the house \uline{of} the Lord ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

I will ask \uline{for} your good.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and \uline{to} the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the \uline{Ho}ly Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the begin\uline{ning}, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ev\uline{er}. Amen.
