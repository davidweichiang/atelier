\noindent Out of the depths I cry to you, \uline{O} Lord,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

Lord, hear \uline{my} voice!

\noindent O let your ears be \uline{at}tentive~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

to the voice of \uline{my} pleading.

\noindent If you, O Lord, should mark \uline{our} guilt,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

Lord, who would \uline{sur}vive?

\noindent But with you is found \uline{for}giveness:~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

for this we \uline{re}vere you.

\noindent My soul is waiting for \uline{the} Lord,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

I count on \uline{his} word.

\noindent My soul is longing for \uline{the} Lord~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

more than watchman \uline{for} daybreak.

\noindent Let the watchman count \uline{on} daybreak~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and Israel on \uline{the} Lord.

\noindent Because with the Lord there \uline{is} mercy~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and fullness of \uline{re}demption,

\noindent Israel indeed he will \uline{re}deem~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

from all its \uline{in}iquity.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to \uline{the} Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Ho\uline{ly} Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, \uline{is} now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. \uline{A}men.
