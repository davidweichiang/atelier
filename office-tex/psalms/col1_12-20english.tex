\noindent Let us give thanks to the Father~$\star$~\nopagebreak

for having made you worthy

\noindent to share the lot of the saints~$\star$~\nopagebreak

in light.

\noindent He rescued us~$\star$~\nopagebreak

from the power of darkness

\noindent and brought us~$\star$~\nopagebreak

into the kingdom of his beloved Son.

\noindent Through him we have redemption,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

the forgiveness of our sins.

\noindent He is the image of the invisible God,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

the first-born of all creatures.

\noindent In him everything in heaven and on earth was created,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

things visible and invisible.

\noindent All were created through him;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

all were created for him.

\noindent He is before all else that is.~$\star$~\nopagebreak

In him everything continues in being.

\noindent It is he who is head of the body, the church!~$\star$~\nopagebreak

he who is the beginning,

\noindent the first-born of the dead,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

so that primacy may be his in everything.

\noindent It pleased God to make absolute fullness reside in him~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and, by means of him, to reconcile everything in his person,

\noindent both on earth and in the heavens,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

making peace through the blood of his cross.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
