\noindent Let us give thanks to the Father~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

for having made you worthy

\noindent to share the lot of the saints~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

in light.

\noindent He rescued us~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

from the power of darkness

\noindent and brought us~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

into the kingdom of his beloved Son.

\noindent Through him we have redemption,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

the forgiveness of our sins.

\noindent He is the image of the invisible God,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

the first-born of all creatures.

\noindent In him everything in heaven and on earth was created,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

things visible and invisible.

\noindent All were created through him;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

all were created for him.

\noindent He is before all else that is.~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

In him everything continues in being.

\noindent It is he who is head of the body, the church!~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

he who is the beginning,

\noindent the first-born of the dead,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

so that primacy may be his in everything.

\noindent It pleased God to make absolute fullness reside in him~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and, by means of him, to reconcile everything in his person,

\noindent both on earth and in the heavens,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

making peace through the blood of his cross.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
