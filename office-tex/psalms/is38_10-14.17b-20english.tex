\noindent Once I said,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

“In the noontime of life I must depart!

\noindent To the gates of the nether world I shall be consigned~$\star$~\nopagebreak

for the rest of my years.”

\noindent I said, “I shall see the Lord no more~$\star$~\nopagebreak

in the land of the living.

\noindent No longer shall I behold my fellow men~$\star$~\nopagebreak

among those who dwell in the world.”

\noindent My dwelling, like a shepherd’s tent,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

is struck down and borne away from me;

\noindent you have folded up my life, like a weaver~$\star$~\nopagebreak

who severs the last thread.

\noindent Day and night you give me over to torment;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

I cry out until the dawn.

\noindent Like a lion he breaks all my bones;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

day and night you give me over to torment.

\noindent Like a swallow I utter shrill cries;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

I moan like a dove.

\noindent My eyes grow weak, gazing heaven-ward:~$\star$~\nopagebreak

O Lord, I am in straits; be my surety!

\noindent You have preserved my life~$\star$~\nopagebreak

from the pit of destruction,

\noindent When you cast behind your back~$\star$~\nopagebreak

all my sins.

\noindent For it is not the nether world that gives you thanks,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

nor death that praises you;

\noindent Neither do those who go down into the pit~$\star$~\nopagebreak

await your kindness.

\noindent The living, the living give you thanks,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

as I do today.

\noindent Fathers declare to their sons,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

O God, your faithfulness.

\noindent The Lord is our savior;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

we shall sing to stringed instruments

\noindent In the house of the Lord~$\star$~\nopagebreak

all the days of our life.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
