\noindent Lord, who shall be admitted \uline{to} your tent~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and dwell on your \uline{ho}ly mountain?

\noindent He who walks \uline{with}out fault;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

he who \uline{acts} with justice

\noindent and speaks the truth \uline{from} his heart;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

he who does not slander \uline{with} his tongue;

\noindent he who do no wrong \uline{to} his brother,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

who casts no slur \uline{on} his neighbor,

\noindent who holds the godless \uline{in} disdain,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

but honors those who \uline{fear} the Lord;

\noindent he who keeps his pledge, \uline{come} what may;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

who takes no interest \uline{on} a loan

\noindent and accepts no bribes a\uline{gainst} the innocent.~$\star$~\nopagebreak

Such a man will stand \uline{firm} for ever.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and \uline{to} the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the \uline{Ho}ly Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the begin\uline{ning}, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ev\uline{er}. Amen.
