\noindent O come, bless the Lord,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

all you who serve the Lord,

\noindent who stand in the house of the Lord,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

in the courts of the house of our God.

\noindent Lift up your hands to the holy place~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and bless the Lord through the night.

\noindent May the Lord bless you from Zion,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

he who made both heaven and earth.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
