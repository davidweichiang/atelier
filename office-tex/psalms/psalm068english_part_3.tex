\noindent As for me in my poverty and pain~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

let your help, O God, lift me up.

\noindent I will praise God’s name with a song;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

I will glorify him with thanksgiving,

\noindent a gift pleasing God more than oxen,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

more than beasts prepared for sacrifice.

\noindent The poor when they see it will be glad~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and God-seeking hearts will revive;

\noindent for the Lord listens to the needy~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and does not spurn his servants in their chains.

\noindent Let the heavens and the earth give him praise,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

the sea and all its living creatures.

\noindent For God will bring help to Zion~†~\nopagebreak

and rebuild the cities of Judah~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and men shall dwell there in possession.

\noindent The sons of his servants shall inherit it;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

those who love his name shall dwell there.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
