\noindent In you, O Lord, I take refuge.~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

Let me never be put to shame.

\noindent In your justice, set me free,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

hear me and speedily rescue me.

\noindent Be a rock of refuge for me,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

a mighty stronghold to save me,

\noindent for you are my rock, my stronghold.~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

For your nameâ€™s sake, lead me and guide me.

\noindent Release me from the snares they have hidden~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

for you are my refuge, Lord.

\noindent Into your hands I commend my spirit.~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

It is you who will redeem me, Lord.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
