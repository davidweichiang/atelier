\noindent Christ suffered for \uline{you,}~†~\nopagebreak

and left you \uline{an} example ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

to have you follow \uline{in} his footsteps.

\noindent He \uline{did} no wrong; ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

no deceit was found \uline{in} his mouth.

\noindent When he \uline{was} insulted, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

he re\uline{turned} no insult.

\noindent When he was \uline{made} to suffer, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

he did not count\uline{er} with threats.

\noindent Instead he delivered \uline{him}self up ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

to the One who \uline{judg}es justly.

\noindent In \uline{his} own body ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

he brought your sins \uline{to} the cross,

\noindent so that all of us, dead to \uline{sin,}~†~\nopagebreak

could live in accord \uline{with} God’s will. ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

By his wounds \uline{you} were healed.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and \uline{to} the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the \uline{Ho}ly Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the begin\uline{ning}, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ev\uline{er}. Amen.
