\noindent My soul, give praise to the \uline{Lord};~†~\nopagebreak

I will praise the Lord \uline{all} my days,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

make music to my God \uline{while} I live.

\noindent Put no \uline{trust} in princes,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

in mortal men in whom there \uline{is} no help.

\noindent Take their breath, they re\uline{turn} to clay~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and their plans that day \uline{come} to nothing.

\noindent He is happy who is helped by \uline{Ja}cob’s God,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

whose hope is in the \uline{Lord} his God,

\noindent who alone made heav\uline{en} and earth,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

the seas and all \uline{they} contain.

\noindent It is he who keeps \uline{faith} for ever,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

who is just to those who \uline{are} oppressed.

\noindent It is he who gives bread \uline{to} the hungry,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

the Lord, who sets pris\uline{on}ers free,

\noindent the Lord who gives sight \uline{to} the blind,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

who raises up those who \uline{are} bowed down,

\noindent the Lord, who pro\uline{tects} the stranger~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and upholds the wid\uline{ow} and orphan.

\noindent It is the Lord who \uline{loves} the just~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

but thwarts the path \uline{of} the wicked.

\noindent The Lord will \uline{reign} for ever,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

Zion’s God, from \uline{age} to age.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and \uline{to} the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the \uline{Ho}ly Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the begin\uline{ning}, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ev\uline{er}. Amen.
