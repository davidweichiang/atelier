\noindent Let us give thanks to the Father for having made \uline{you} worthy~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

to share the lot of the saints \uline{in} light.

\noindent He rescued us from the power \uline{of} darkness~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and brought us into the kingdom of his belov\uline{ed} Son.

\noindent Through him we have \uline{re}demption,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

the forgiveness of \uline{our} sins.

\noindent He is the image of the invisi\uline{ble} God,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

the first-born of \uline{all} creatures.

\noindent In him everything in heaven and on earth was \uline{cre}ated,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

things visible and \uline{in}visible.

\noindent All were created \uline{through} him;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

all were created \uline{for} him.

\noindent He is before all else \uline{that} is.~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

In him everything continues \uline{in} being.

\noindent It is he who is head of the body, \uline{the} church!~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

he who is the \uline{be}ginning,

\noindent the first-born of \uline{the} dead,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

so that primacy may be his \uline{in} everything.

\noindent It pleased God to make absolute fullness reside \uline{in} him~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and, by means of him, to reconcile everything in \uline{his} person,

\noindent both on earth and in \uline{the} heavens,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

making peace through the blood of \uline{his} cross.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to \uline{the} Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Ho\uline{ly} Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, \uline{is} now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. \uline{A}men.
