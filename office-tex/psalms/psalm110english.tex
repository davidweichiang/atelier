\noindent I will thank the Lord with all my heart ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

in the meeting of the just and their assembly.

\noindent Great are the works of the Lord, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

to be pondered by all who love them.



\noindent Majestic and glorious his work, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

his justice stands firm for ever.

\noindent He makes us remember his wonders. ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

The Lord is compassion and love.



\noindent He gives food to those who fear him; ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

keeps his covenant ever in mind.

\noindent He has shown his might to his people ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

by giving them the lands of the nations.



\noindent His works are justice and truth, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

his precepts are all of them sure,

\noindent standing firm for ever and ever; ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

they are made in uprightness and truth.



\noindent He has sent deliverance to his people~†~\nopagebreak

and established his covenant for ever. ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

Holy his name, to be feared.



\noindent To fear the Lord is the first stage of wisdom;~†~\nopagebreak

all who do so prove themselves wise. ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

His praise shall last for ever!



\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
