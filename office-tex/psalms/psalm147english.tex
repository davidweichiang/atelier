\noindent O praise the Lord, Jerusalem!~$\star$~\nopagebreak

Zion, praise your God!

\noindent He has strengthened the bars of your gates,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

he has blessed the children within you.

\noindent He established peace on your borders,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

he feeds you with finest wheat.

\noindent He sends out his word to the earth~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and swiftly runs his command.

\noindent He showers down snow white as wool,~†~\nopagebreak

he scatters hoar-frost like ashes.~$\star$~\nopagebreak

He hurls down hailstones like crumbs.

\noindent The waters are frozen at his touch;~†~\nopagebreak

he sends forth his word and it melts them:~$\star$~\nopagebreak

at the breath of his mouth the waters flow.

\noindent He makes his word known to Jacob,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

to Israel his laws and decrees.

\noindent He has not dealt thus with other nations;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

he has not taught them his decrees.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
