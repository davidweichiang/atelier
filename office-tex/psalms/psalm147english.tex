\noindent O praise the Lord, Jerusalem!~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

Zion, praise your God!

\noindent He has strengthened the bars of your gates,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

he has blessed the children within you.

\noindent He established peace on your borders,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

he feeds you with finest wheat.

\noindent He sends out his word to the earth~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and swiftly runs his command.

\noindent He showers down snow white as wool,~†~\nopagebreak

he scatters hoar-frost like ashes.~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

He hurls down hailstones like crumbs.

\noindent The waters are frozen at his touch;~†~\nopagebreak

he sends forth his word and it melts them:~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

at the breath of his mouth the waters flow.

\noindent He makes his word known to Jacob,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

to Israel his laws and decrees.

\noindent He has not dealt thus with other nations;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

he has not taught them his decrees.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
