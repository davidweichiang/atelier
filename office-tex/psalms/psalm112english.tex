\noindent Praise, O servants of the Lord,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

praise the name of the Lord!

\noindent May the name of the Lord be blessed~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

both now and for evermore!

\noindent From the rising of the sun to its setting~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

praised be the name of the Lord!

\noindent High above all nations is the Lord,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

above the heavens his glory.

\noindent Who is like the Lord, our God,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

who has risen on high to his throne

\noindent yet stoops from the heights to look down,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

to look down upon heaven and earth?

\noindent From the dust he lifts up the lowly,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

from his misery he raises the poor

\noindent to set him in the company of princes,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

yes, with the princes of his people.

\noindent To the childless wife he gives a home~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and gladdens her heart with children.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
