\noindent Praise, O servants of the Lord,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

praise the name of the Lord!

\noindent May the name of the Lord be blessed~$\star$~\nopagebreak

both now and for evermore!

\noindent From the rising of the sun to its setting~$\star$~\nopagebreak

praised be the name of the Lord!

\noindent High above all nations is the Lord,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

above the heavens his glory.

\noindent Who is like the Lord, our God,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

who has risen on high to his throne

\noindent yet stoops from the heights to look down,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

to look down upon heaven and earth?

\noindent From the dust he lifts up the lowly,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

from his misery he raises the poor

\noindent to set him in the company of princes,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

yes, with the princes of his people.

\noindent To the childless wife he gives a home~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and gladdens her heart with children.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
