\noindent The Lord’s is the earth and its fullness,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

the world and all its peoples.

\noindent It is he who set it on the seas;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

on the waters he made it firm.

\noindent Who shall climb the mountain of the Lord?~$\star$~\nopagebreak

Who shall stand in his holy place?

\noindent The man with clean hands and pure heart,~†~\nopagebreak

who desires not worthless things,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

who has not sworn so as to deceive his neighbor.

\noindent He shall receive blessings from the Lord~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and reward from the God who saves him.

\noindent Such are the men who seek him,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

seek the face of the God of Jacob.

\noindent O gates, lift high your heads;~†~\nopagebreak

grow higher, ancient doors.*

Let him enter, the king of glory!

\noindent Who is the king of glory?~†~\nopagebreak

The Lord, the mighty, the valiant,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

the Lord, the valiant in war.

\noindent O gates, lift high your heads;~†~\nopagebreak

grow higher, ancient doors.~$\star$~\nopagebreak

Let him enter, the king of glory!

\noindent Who is he, the king of glory?~†~\nopagebreak

He, the Lord of armies,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

he is the king of glory.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
