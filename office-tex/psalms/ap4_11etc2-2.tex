\noindent O Lord our God, you \uline{are} worthy ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

to receive glory and honor \uline{and} power.

\noindent For you have created \uline{all} things; ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

by your will they came to be and \uline{were} made.

\noindent Worthy are you, \uline{O} Lord, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

to receive the scroll and break open \uline{its} seals.

\noindent For you \uline{were} slain;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

with your blood you purchased \uline{for} God

\noindent men of every race \uline{and} tongue,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

of every people \uline{and} nation.

\noindent You made of them a \uline{kingdom},~†~\nopagebreak

and priests to serve \uline{our} God,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and they shall reign on \uline{the} earth.

\noindent Worthy is the Lamb that \uline{was} slain~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

to receive power \uline{and} riches,

\noindent wisdom \uline{and} strength, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

honor and glory \uline{and} praise.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to \uline{the} Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Ho\uline{ly} Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, \uline{is} now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. \uline{A}men.
