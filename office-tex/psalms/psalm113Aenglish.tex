\noindent When Israel came forth from Egypt,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

Jacob’s sons from an alien people,

\noindent Judah became the Lord’s temple,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

Israel became his kingdom.

\noindent The sea fled at the sight:~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

the Jordan turned back on its course,

\noindent the mountains leapt like rams~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and the hills like yearling sheep.

\noindent Why was it, sea, that you fled,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

that you turned back, Jordan, on your course?

\noindent Mountains, that you leapt like rams,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

hills, like yearling sheep?

\noindent Tremble, O earth, before the Lord,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

in the presence of the God of Jacob,

\noindent who turns the rock into a pool~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and flint into a spring of water.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
