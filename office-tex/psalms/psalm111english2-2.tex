\noindent Happy the man who fears \uline{the} Lord,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

who takes delight in all his \uline{com}mands.

\noindent His sons will be powerful \uline{on} earth;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

the children of the upright \uline{are} blessed.

\noindent Riches and wealth are in \uline{his} house;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

his justice stands firm \uline{for} ever.

\noindent He is a light in the darkness for \uline{the} upright:~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

he is generous, merciful \uline{and} just.

\noindent The good man takes pity \uline{and} lends,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

he conducts his affairs \uline{with} honor.

\noindent The just man will nev\uline{er} waver:~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

he will be remembered \uline{for} ever.

\noindent He has no fear of ev\uline{il} news;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

with a firm heart he trusts in \uline{the} Lord.

\noindent With a steadfast heart he will \uline{not} fear;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

he will see the downfall of \uline{his} foes.

\noindent Open-handed, he gives to the \uline{poor};~†~\nopagebreak

his justice stands firm \uline{for} ever.~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

His head will be raised \uline{in} glory.

\noindent The wicked man sees and is \uline{angry},~†~\nopagebreak

grinds his teeth and fades \uline{a}way;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

the desire of the wicked leads \uline{to} doom.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to \uline{the} Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Ho\uline{ly} Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, \uline{is} now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. \uline{A}men.
