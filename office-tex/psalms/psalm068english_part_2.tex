\noindent This is my prayer to you,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

my prayer for your favor.

\noindent In your great love, answer me, O God,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

with your help that never fails:

\noindent rescue me from sinking in the mud;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

save me from my foes.

\noindent Save me from the waters of the deep~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

lest the waves overwhelm me.

\noindent Do not let the deep engulf me~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

nor death close its mouth on me.

\noindent Lord, answer, for your love is kind;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

in your compassion, turn towards me.

\noindent Do not hide your face from your servant;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

answer quickly for I am in distress.

\noindent Come close to my soul and redeem me;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

ransom me pressed by my foes.

\noindent You know how they taunt and deride me;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

my oppressors are all before you.

\noindent Taunts have broken my heart;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

I have reached the end of my strength.

\noindent I looked in vain for compassion,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

for consolers; not one could I find.

\noindent For food they gave me poison;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
