\noindent This is my prayer to you,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

my prayer for your favor.

\noindent In your great love, answer me, O God,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

with your help that never fails:

\noindent rescue me from sinking in the mud;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

save me from my foes.

\noindent Save me from the waters of the deep~$\star$~\nopagebreak

lest the waves overwhelm me.

\noindent Do not let the deep engulf me~$\star$~\nopagebreak

nor death close its mouth on me.

\noindent Lord, answer, for your love is kind;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

in your compassion, turn towards me.

\noindent Do not hide your face from your servant;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

answer quickly for I am in distress.

\noindent Come close to my soul and redeem me;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

ransom me pressed by my foes.

\noindent You know how they taunt and deride me;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

my oppressors are all before you.

\noindent Taunts have broken my heart;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

I have reached the end of my strength.

\noindent I looked in vain for compassion,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

for consolers; not one could I find.

\noindent For food they gave me poison;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
