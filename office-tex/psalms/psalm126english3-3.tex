\noindent If the Lord does not \uline{build} the house, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

in vain do its \uline{build}ers labor;

\noindent if the Lord does not watch ov\uline{er} the city, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

in vain does the watch\uline{man} keep vigil.

\noindent In vain is your ear\uline{li}er rising, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

your going lat\uline{er} to rest,

\noindent you who toil for the \uline{bread} you eat, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

when he pours gifts on his beloved \uline{while} they slumber.

\noindent Truly sons are a gift \uline{from} the Lord, ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

a blessing, the fruit \uline{of} the womb.

\noindent Indeed the \uline{sons} of youth ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

are like arrows in the hand \uline{of} a warrior.

\noindent O the happiness \uline{of} the man ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

who has filled his quiver \uline{with} these arrows!

\noindent He will have no \uline{cause} for shame ~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

when he disputes with his foes \uline{in} the gateways.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and \uline{to} the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the \uline{Ho}ly Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the begin\uline{ning}, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ev\uline{er}. Amen.
