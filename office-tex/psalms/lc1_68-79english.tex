\hspace{2pt} he has come to his people and set them free.

born of the house of his servant David.

  that he would save us from our enemies,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

  from the hands of all who hate us.

\noindent He promised to show mercy to our fathers~$\star$~\nopagebreak

to set us free from the hands of our enemies,

\noindent free to worship him without fear,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

holy and righteous in his sight all the days of our life.

\noindent You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,

\noindent to give his people knowledge of salvation~$\star$~\nopagebreak


by the forgiveness of their sins.

\noindent In the tender compassion of our God~$\star$~\nopagebreak


the dawn from on high shall break upon us,

\noindent to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to guide our feet into the way of peace.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
