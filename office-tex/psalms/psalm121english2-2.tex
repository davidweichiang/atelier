\noindent I rejoiced when I heard \uline{them} say: ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

“Let us go to \uline{God’s} house.”

\noindent And now our feet \uline{are} standing ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

within your gates, O \uline{Je}rusalem.

\noindent Jerusalem is built as \uline{a} city ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

strongly \uline{com}pact.

\noindent It is there that the tribes \uline{go} up, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

the tribes of \uline{the} Lord.

\noindent For Israel’s law \uline{it} is, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

there to praise the \uline{Lord’s} name.

\noindent There were set the thrones \uline{of} judgment ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

of the house \uline{of} David.

\noindent For the peace of Jerusa\uline{lem} pray: ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

“Peace be to \uline{your} homes!

\noindent May peace reign in \uline{your} walls, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

in your pala\uline{ces,} peace!”

\noindent For love of my brethren \uline{and} friends ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

I say: “Peace \uline{up}on you.”

\noindent For love of the house of \uline{the} Lord ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

I will ask for \uline{your} good.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to \uline{the} Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Ho\uline{ly} Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, \uline{is} now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. \uline{A}men.
