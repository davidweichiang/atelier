\noindent Save me, O God,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

for the waters have risen to my neck.

\noindent I have sunk into the mud of the deep~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and there is no foothold.

\noindent I have entered the waters of the deep~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and the waves overwhelm me.

\noindent I am wearied with all my crying,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

my throat is parched.

\noindent My eyes are wasted away~$\star$~\nopagebreak

from looking for my God.

\noindent More numerous than the hairs on my head~$\star$~\nopagebreak

are those who hate me without cause.

\noindent Those who attack me with lies~$\star$~\nopagebreak

are too much for my strength.

\noindent How can I restore~$\star$~\nopagebreak

what I have never stolen?

\noindent O God, you know my sinful folly;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

my sins you can see.

\noindent Let those who hope in you not be put to shame~$\star$~\nopagebreak

through me, Lord of hosts:

\noindent let not those who seek you be dismayed~$\star$~\nopagebreak

through me, God of Israel.

\noindent It is for you that I suffer taunts,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

that shame covers my face,

\noindent that I have become a stranger to my brothers,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

an alien to my own mother’s sons.

\noindent I burn with zeal for your house~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and taunts against you fall on me.

\noindent When I afflict my soul with fasting~$\star$~\nopagebreak

they make it a taunt against me.

\noindent When I put on sackcloth in mourning~$\star$~\nopagebreak

then they make me a byword,

\noindent the gossip of men at the gates,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

the subject of drunkards’ songs.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
