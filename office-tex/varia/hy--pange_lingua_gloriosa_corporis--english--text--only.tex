Sing my tongue the Sacred Myst'ry,

\noindent Of the glorious body made,

\noindent Of the precious blood outpouring--

\noindent Both the fruit of noble maid--

\noindent By the King of all the nations

\noindent For the world's redemption paid.

\noindent 

2. Giv'n for us, to us descending,

\noindent Born of virgin chaste was he,

\noindent And on earth by life and teaching

\noindent Spread the truth to make us free;

\noindent Then with sacred celebration

\noindent Closed his life most wondrously.

\noindent 

3. On the night of that last supper

\noindent Seated with his brethren band,

\noindent He observed the law most fully

\noindent And the feast it did command;

\noindent Then, as food to his apostles,

\noindent Gives himself with his own hand.

\noindent 

4. Word made Flesh, true bread he changes

\noindent By a word, his flesh to be;

\noindent Wine to blood of Christ transforming,

\noindent Though the eye no change may see;

\noindent Faith alone provides assurance,

\noindent If the heart sincere should be.

\noindent 

5. Humbly then in veneration

\noindent This great Myst'ry we adore:

\noindent For the ancient rite surrenders

\noindent To the new for evermore:

\noindent Faith divine supplies abundance

\noindent Where frail senses cannot soar.

\noindent 

6. Honor, praise and exaltation

\noindent To the Father and the Son,

\noindent Power, too, and joy and blessing

\noindent And salvation for all won;

\noindent To the One from both proceeding,

\noindent Be an equal worship done. Amen.
