Thirty years among us dwelling,
His appointed time fulfilled,
Born for this he meets his passion,
This indeed he freely willed;
On the cross the Lamb is lifted
Where his lifeblood shall be spilled.

2. He endured the nails, the spitting,
Vinegar and spear and reed;
From that holy body broken,
Blood and water forth proceed:
Earth and stars and sky and ocean,
By that flood from stain are freed.

3. Faithful Cross! Above all others,
One and only noble tree!
None in foliage, none in blossom,
None in fruit, your peer may be;
Precious wood and precious fast'ning,
Precious weight upheld in plea.

4. Bend your boughs, O Tree of glory!
Your relaxing sinews bend;
For a while the ancient rigor,
That your birth bestowed, suspend;
And the King of heav'nly beauty
On your bosom gently tend.

5. You alone were counted worthy
This world's ransom to sustain,
That a shipwrecked race forever
Might the port of refuge gain;
With the sacred blood anointed
Of the Lamb for sinners slain.

6. Praise and honor to the Father;
Praise and honor to the Son,
Praise and honor to the Spirit,
Ever three and ever one;
Consubstantial, coeternal,
While unending ages run.
Amen.
