Sing, my tongue, the noble battle

\noindent With completed vict'ry rife;

\noindent O'er the cross, that Victor's trophy

\noindent Tell the triumph of the strife:

\noindent How the world's Redeemer conquered

\noindent By surrend'ring of his life.

\noindent 

2. God, his Maker, with compassion

\noindent When the first-made Adam fell,

\noindent When he ate the fruit of sorrow,

\noindent Whose reward was death and hell,

\noindent Noted then this Wood, the ruin

\noindent Of the ancient wood to quell.

\noindent 

3. This, the work of our salvation,

\noindent He appointed to atone;

\noindent To the traitor's wiles opposing

\noindent Art more subtle than his own;

\noindent And from there would bring the healing

\noindent Where the harm had first been sown.

\noindent 

4. Wherefore, then with sacred fullness

\noindent Of the destined time complete,

\noindent He was sent, the world's creator

\noindent From the Father's heav'nly seat;

\noindent And, from Virgin born, proceeded,

\noindent God made Man, the foe to meet.

\noindent 

5. There he lies an infant weeping

\noindent Where the narrow manger stands;

\noindent And his limbs the virgin-mother

\noindent Warm enfolds in swaddling bands;

\noindent Meetly thus, with garment wrapping,

\noindent Binding feet and legs and hands.

\noindent 

6. Praise and honor to the Father;

\noindent Praise and honor to the Son,

\noindent Praise and honor to the Spirit,

\noindent Ever three and ever one;

\noindent Consubstantial, coeternal,

\noindent While unending ages run. Amen.
