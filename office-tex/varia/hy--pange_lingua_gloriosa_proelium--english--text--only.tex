Sing my tongue the Sacred Myst'ry,
Of the glorious body made,
Of the precious blood outpouring--
Both the fruit of noble maid--
By the King of all the nations
For the world's redemption paid.

2. Giv'n for us, to us descending,
Born of virgin chaste was he,
And on earth by life and teaching
Spread the truth to make us free;
Then with sacred celebration
Closed his life most wondrously.

3. On the night of that last supper
Seated with his brethren band,
He observed the law most fully
And the feast it did command;
Then, as food to his apostles,
Gives himself with his own hand.

4. Word made Flesh, true bread he changes
By a word, his flesh to be;
Wine to blood of Christ transforming,
Though the eye no change may see;
Faith alone provides assurance,
If the heart sincere should be.

5. Humbly then in veneration
This great Myst'ry we adore:
For the ancient rite surrenders
To the new for evermore:
Faith divine supplies abundance
Where frail senses cannot soar.

6. Honor, praise and exaltation
To the Father and the Son,
Power, too, and joy and blessing
And salvation for all won;
To the One from both proceeding,
Be an equal worship done.
Amen.
