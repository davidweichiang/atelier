Sing, my tongue, the noble battle
With completed vict'ry rife;
O'er the cross, that Victor's trophy
Tell the triumph of the strife:
How the world's Redeemer conquered
By surrend'ring of his life.

2. God, his Maker, with compassion
When the first-made Adam fell,
When he ate the fruit of sorrow,
Whose reward was death and hell,
Noted then this Wood, the ruin
Of the ancient wood to quell.

3. This, the work of our salvation,
He appointed to atone;
To the traitor's wiles opposing
Art more subtle than his own;
And from there would bring the healing
Where the harm had first been sown.

4. Wherefore, then with sacred fullness
Of the destined time complete,
He was sent, the world's creator
From the Father's heav'nly seat;
And, from Virgin born, proceeded,
God made Man, the foe to meet.

5. There he lies an infant weeping
Where the narrow manger stands;
And his limbs the virgin-mother
Warm enfolds in swaddling bands;
Meetly thus, with garment wrapping,
Binding feet and legs and hands.

6. Praise and honor to the Father;
Praise and honor to the Son,
Praise and honor to the Spirit,
Ever three and ever one;
Consubstantial, coeternal,
While unending ages run.
Amen.
