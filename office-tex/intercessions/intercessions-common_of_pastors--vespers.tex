\lettrine[loversize=0.15,lines=2]{J}{}esus Christ is worthy of all praise, for he was appointed high priest among men and their representative before God. We honor him and in our weakness we pray: \Rbar.~Bring salvation to your people, Lord.
\par \Rbar.~Bring salvation to your people, Lord.

You marvelously illuminated your Church through distinguished leaders and holy men and women,
– let Christians rejoice always in such splendor.
\par \Rbar.~Bring salvation to your people, Lord.

You forgave the sins of your people when their holy leaders like Moses sought your compassion,
– through their intercession continue to purify and sanctify your holy people.
\par \Rbar.~Bring salvation to your people, Lord.

In the midst of their brothers and sisters you anointed your holy ones and filled them with the Holy Spirit,
– fill all the leaders of your people with the same Spirit.
\par \Rbar.~Bring salvation to your people, Lord.

You yourself are the only visible possession of our holy pastors,
– let none of them, won at the price of your blood, remain far from you.
\par \Rbar.~Bring salvation to your people, Lord.

The shepherds of your Church keep your flock from being snatched out of your hand. Through them you give your flock eternal life,
– save those who have died, those for whom you gave up your life.
\par \Rbar.~Bring salvation to your people, Lord.
