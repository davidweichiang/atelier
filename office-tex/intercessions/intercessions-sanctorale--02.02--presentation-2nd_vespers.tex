\lettrine[loversize=0.15,lines=2]{T}{}oday our Savior was presented in the temple. Let us adore him as we say:
\par \Rbar. Lord, may our eyes see your saving power.

Christ Jesus, you are the light that enlightens all nations,
– shine upon those who do not know you, that they may come to believe in you, the one, true God.
\par \Rbar. Lord, may our eyes see your saving power.

You are the redeemer and glory of your people Israel,
– may your Church proclaim your salvation to the ends of the earth.
\par \Rbar. Lord, may our eyes see your saving power.

Jesus, desire of the nations, Simeon, the just man, rejoiced at your coming,
– lead all men to recognize that you still come to them.
\par \Rbar. Lord, may our eyes see your saving power.

Lord, when you were presented in the temple, Simeon foretold that a sword of sorrow would pierce your mother’s heart,
– strengthen us to accept the sufferings we endure for the sake of your name.
\par \Rbar. Lord, may our eyes see your saving power.

Christ Jesus, joy of all the saints, Simeon longed to see you before he died, and his prayer was answered,
– hear our plea for all the dead who still yearn to see you face to face.
\par \Rbar. Lord, may our eyes see your saving power.
