\lettrine[lines=3]{L}{}ook, we pray, O Lord, on this your family,
for whom our Lord Jesus Christ
did not hesitate to be delivered into the hands of the wicked
and submit to the agony of the Cross.
Who lives and reigns with you
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever. \par \Rbar. Amen.
