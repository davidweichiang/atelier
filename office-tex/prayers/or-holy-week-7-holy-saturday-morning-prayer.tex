\lettrine[lines=3]{A}{}ll-powerful and ever-living God,
your only Son went down among the dead
and rose again in glory.
In your goodness
raise up your faithful people,
buried with him in baptism,
to be one with him
in the everlasting life of heaven,
where he lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever. \par \Rbar. Amen.
